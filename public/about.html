<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Interests</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I like to play padel two to three times a week.</li>
  <li>Another thing that I like to do is to play different 
  types of games like boardgames and videogames.</li>
  <li>Taking a long walk is a good way of giving the head a 
  break when I have worked long on a specifik problem.
  <br />I often then find the solution of the problem.</li>
  <li>I like to solve problems like when you are coding and have to think through some logic to make it work.</li>
  <li>I am pretty stubborn when it comes to solve a problem but if I get stuck for to long I ask someone for help.</li>
</ul>
